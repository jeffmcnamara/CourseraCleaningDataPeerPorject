This repository is for the Getting and Cleaning Data course
on Coursera. It included the r script run_analysis.R which loads the data into
r from a local directory.  It combines
the test and training data, adds the feature names, selects the columns with mean
and standard deviation(std), adds the subject and activity data then averages
the vales for each subject by activity. 
The following is included in the repository.



run_analysis.R - annotated r code for the cleaning and
organizing of the data set.



data_mean_std.csv - tidy data set for all mean and standard
deviation data



average.csv - data for each subject averaged by activity



CodeBook.Rmd - Code book for the values with the r script
included
